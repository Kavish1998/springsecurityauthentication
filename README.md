Introduction
This discussion explored how to secure Spring Boot project endpoints using JWT-based security. JSON Web Token (JWT) has become a popular choice for securing web applications due to its stateless nature and simplicity. By integrating Spring Boot with JWT, we can implement a robust authentication and authorization mechanism, ensuring that only authorized users can access your application's resources.

What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?
JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be trusted and verified because it is digitally signed using a secret (via HMAC) or a public/private key pair (via RSA or ECDSA).

1. Setting Up a Spring Boot Project
2. Setting up Entity Class
3. Next, create an enum Role.
4. Next, create a repository for our entity.
5. Create the JWT service
6. Create the Authentication service
7. Override Application Configurations
8. Implement JwtAuthenticationFilter class
9. Configure the Security Configurations
10. Implement required DTOs
11. Implement Controller Classes

Ok, Now we are done with implementation. Let’s test the application.

1. Create Admin User
2. Then, also create a user with the role ‘USER’
3. Now let’s try to log in with the USER role and access the ADMIN controller.
4. Now, try logging in with the USER role and accessing the ADMIN controller.

As you can see only ADMIN users can access the ADMIN controller endpoint.
